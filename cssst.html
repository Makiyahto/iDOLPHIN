<h3>1. What is CSS?</h3>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to control the visual appearance of web pages. It allows developers to define colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and even animations.</p>
<p>While HTML focuses on structure and content, CSS focuses on design and presentation. Without CSS, websites would look plain and difficult to read.</p>
<p><b>Why CSS is important:</b> CSS helps create visually appealing websites, improves user experience, and ensures consistency across multiple pages. It also allows developers to easily update designs without touching HTML content.</p>
<p><b>In real-world use:</b> Almost every modern website relies on CSS for branding, responsiveness, and accessibility.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson">
<h3>2. Ways to Add CSS</h3>
<p>There are three main ways to apply CSS to an HTML document: Inline, Internal, and External.</p>
<p><b>Inline CSS</b> is written directly inside an HTML element. It is best used for quick testing or small adjustments.</p>
<p><b>Internal CSS</b> is written inside a &lt;style&gt; tag within the HTML document's head section. This method is useful when styling a single page.</p>
<p><b>External CSS</b> is written in a separate .css file and linked to HTML. This is the recommended method for most projects.</p>
<p><b>Best practice:</b> External CSS keeps your code clean, organized, and easier to maintain.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson">
<h3>3. CSS Selectors</h3>
<p>CSS selectors define which HTML elements will receive specific styles.</p>
<p>Selectors allow developers to target elements precisely and avoid unnecessary repetition.</p>
<p><b>Common selectors include:</b> element selectors (p, div), class selectors (.box), ID selectors (#header), and the universal selector (*).</p>
<p><b>Why selectors matter:</b> Proper use of selectors improves readability, performance, and scalability of your CSS code.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson">
<h3>4. CSS Properties & Box Model</h3>
<p>CSS properties define how elements look and behave on a webpage. These include color, font-size, margin, padding, and border.</p>
<p>The box model explains how elements take up space on the page.</p>
<p><b>Box model parts:</b> content, padding, border, and margin.</p>
<p><b>Why it matters:</b> Understanding the box model is essential for creating accurate layouts and spacing elements correctly.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson">
<h3>5. Classes vs IDs</h3>
<p>Classes and IDs are both used to apply styles, but they serve different purposes.</p>
<p>Classes can be reused on multiple elements, making them ideal for repeated styles.</p>
<p>IDs must be unique and should only be used once per page.</p>
<p><b>Best practice:</b> Use classes for styling and IDs for unique elements or JavaScript interactions.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson">
<h3>6. CSS Colors & Units</h3>
<p>CSS allows you to define colors using names, HEX values, RGB, RGBA, HSL, and HSLA.</p>
<p>Units define sizes and spacing, such as px, %, em, rem, vh, and vw.</p>
<p><b>Responsive design tip:</b> Relative units like em, rem, and percentages help designs adapt to different screen sizes.</p>
<p><b>Good practice:</b> Use rem for font sizes and spacing for better accessibility.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson">
<h3>7. CSS Layout (Flexbox & Grid)</h3>
<p>CSS layout systems control how elements are arranged on the page.</p>
<p>Flexbox is best for one-dimensional layouts such as rows or columns.</p>
<p>Grid is best for two-dimensional layouts involving rows and columns.</p>
<p><b>Modern web design:</b> Flexbox and Grid replace older layout techniques like floats and tables.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson">
<h3>8. Pseudo-Classes & Pseudo-Elements</h3>
<p>Pseudo-classes style elements based on their state, such as hover, focus, or active.</p>
<p>Pseudo-elements create virtual elements like ::before and ::after.</p>
<p><b>Why they are useful:</b> They add interactivity and decoration without extra HTML.</p>
<p><b>Example uses:</b> Hover effects, icons, badges, and highlights.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson">
<h3>9. CSS Transitions & Animations</h3>
<p>Transitions allow smooth changes between two states.</p>
<p>Animations allow complex motion using keyframes.</p>
<p><b>Why animations matter:</b> They improve user engagement and provide visual feedback.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Use animations sparingly to avoid distracting users.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson">
<h3>10. Responsive Design</h3>
<p>Responsive design ensures websites look good on all screen sizes.</p>
<p>Media queries apply styles based on device width or height.</p>
<p><b>Mobile-first approach:</b> Design for small screens first, then scale up.</p>
<p><b>Why it matters:</b> Most users browse the web using mobile devices.</p>
